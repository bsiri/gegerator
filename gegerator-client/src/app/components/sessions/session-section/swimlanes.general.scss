    Since we need the X-swimlanes component themselves to 
    bear the class '.swimlane', things are a bit more tricky here.
    First we have to programmaticaly set the class from 
    the Component code with HostBinding(), and then use 
    this construct ":host{&.swimlane}" otherwise it wouldn't work.
    Awkward but works.
