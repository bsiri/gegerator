1. Run ng update @angular/core@14 @angular/cli@14 which should bring you to version 14 of Angular.
2. Run ng update @angular/material@14.
3.  In the application's project directory, run ng update @angular/core@15 @angular/cli@15 to update your application to Angular v15.
4. Run ng update @angular/material@15 to update the Material components.
5. app broken, material theming bullshit
6. ng update @angular/core@16 @angular/cli@16
7. ng update @angular/material@16
8. ng update @ngrx/store@16
9. skipping the following step, I think I have no code concerned:
- Due to the removal of the Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc) in v16, projects on v16 and later no longer support View Engine libraries.
  Update your code to remove any reference to @Directive/@Component moduleId property as it does not have any effect and will be removed in v17.
- entryComponents is no longer available and any reference to it can be removed from the @NgModule and @Component public APIs.
- QueryList.filter now supports type guard functions. Since the type will be narrowed, you may have to update your application code that relies on the old behavior.
10. Angular core to v 17
